Dice rollong and dice generation with javascript

The proposal is rpg dice rolling meeting java script.
Here is possible to make a 1d10 dice rolling(and get from 1 to 10),
or something more complex like 6d10(get from 6 to 60),
or even strange things, like 6 sided dice with like numbers like this: -1, 0 , 0 , 5, 9, -3.
